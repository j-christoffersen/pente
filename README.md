# Pente

## What is this?
This is a in-browser playable game of [Pente](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1295/pente). It was built as a final project for [HarvardX's CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). This game features an AI opponent built using an minimax algorithm.

## Why does the code look like [this](https://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2008/3/5/0/NY0100_BBQ-Spaghetti.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1371585656631.jpeg)?

This is the first project I built from scratch. When I built this app I did not know much about organizing code (Note: I wrote this code WAY before I created the repo). I am currently in the process of rewriting this app in React/Redux, which you can find [here](https://github.com/j-christoffersen/pente-ii).
